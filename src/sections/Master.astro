      The brand was created by Engineer <b>Alberto Partida Hermosillo</b>, a
      Master Tequilero from the third generation of the Partida family. He grew
      up in a town of honest and hardworking people, and decided that his brand
      should carry the name of the village where he grew up: AMATITEÃ‘A. This
      represents a high value in its process, aiming to preserve the ancestral
      traditions of Jalisco, the agave fields, and the production of Tequila.
